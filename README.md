# Node Weather App

This application is designed to provide weather information based on user input and location data. This README file will guide you through the setup process and explain how to use the app effectively.

## Features

- Node.js and Express.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (for storing location data)
- Postman (for managing API requests)

## Usage

The Weather App provides a simple RESTful API for retrieving weather information.

### API Endpoints

#### Get Weather by Location

- **Endpoint**: `/api/weather`
- **Method**: GET
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `location`: The name of the location to fetch weather data for (e.g., `London`).
- **Response**:
  - On success, the API will respond with a JSON object containing weather information for the specified location.
  - On failure, an appropriate error message will be returned.

### Example Usage

To retrieve weather data for London, make a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/weather?location=London`. The response will include details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for that location.
